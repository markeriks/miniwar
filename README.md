# Game of War - Card Duel

This is a simple browser-based card game inspired by the classic card game *War*. Two players—You vs. the Computer—each draw one card per round. The player with the higher card wins the round and earns a point. If both cards have the same value, it's a tie ("War!") and no points are awarded.
